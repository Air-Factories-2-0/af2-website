Given the intrinsic multidisciplinarity of the objectives, the project involves the collaboration of 4 university staff units related to disciplinary scientific fields in areas 03 and 09. The principal investigator (ING-INF/05) has important skills, attested by scientific production, on the use of blockchain, smart contract and crypto-processor technologies for the implementation of decentralized platforms. The other units involved will provide expertise in the implementation of physical infrastructure (3D printing machines) and quality control processes (ING-IND/14 and ING-IND/15) and in the analysis of materials for identification activities (CHIM/07). 
A group of research fellows joined the project with enthusiasm and are already working on the implementation of the platform.
